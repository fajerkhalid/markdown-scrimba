I have already completed several projects through the **Scrimba course** on "*HTML and CSS*". You can view some of my work here: [GitHub](https://github.com/fajerkhalid). Utilizing the knowledge gained from this course, I successfully created a personal music portfolio website ([fajerkhalid.pages.dev](fajerkhalid.pages.dev)) with the help of a **Bootstrap design template**. Below, I have *included image snippets** of the website.

I took on the challenge of creating my **first README page** using **Markdown**, and I am pleased to share that this page is the result. I utilized the "*dev.to*" platform to code it, demonstrating my ability to effectively apply my Markdown skills in a practical project.
